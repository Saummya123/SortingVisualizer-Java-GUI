# SortingVisualizer - Java GUI Project

## 📌 Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based application designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work through interactive graphical animations. The visualizer offers an educational and engaging experience by demonstrating step-by-step sorting processes.

## 🎯 Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly and intuitive Java Swing-based GUI.
- **Sorting Algorithms Supported:**SortingVisualizer - Java GUI Project
📌 Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based application designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work through interactive graphical animations. The visualizer offers an educational and engaging experience by demonstrating step-by-step sorting processes.

🎯 Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly and intuitive Java Swing-based GUI.

Sorting Algorithms Supported:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Radix Sort

Real-Time Visualization: Watch the algorithms sort elements live on screen.

Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of animation to suit your understanding.

Array Size Control: Customize the number of elements to be sorted.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your machine.

An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional but recommended).

Setup Instructions
Clone this repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Saummya123/SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI.git
Navigate into the project directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI
Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Build and run the Main class to start the application.

Use the GUI to select a sorting algorithm, adjust speed and array size, then visualize the sorting process.

🛠️ How It Works
The application initializes a random array of integers.

When you select a sorting algorithm and click "Start," the algorithm begins sorting the array.

The GUI displays each step visually by animating bars representing array elements.

You can pause, resume, or reset the visualization anytime.

🤝 Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and contribute by adding more sorting algorithms, improving the GUI, or optimizing performance. Please submit pull requests with clear descriptions.
