# SortingVisualizer - Java GUI Project

## 📌 Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based application designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work through interactive graphical animations. The visualizer offers an educational and engaging experience by demonstrating step-by-step sorting processes.

## 🎯 Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly and intuitive Java Swing-based GUI.
- **Supported Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Radix Sort
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch sorting algorithms animate step-by-step.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Control animation speed for better understanding.
- **Custom Array Size:** Choose the number of elements to sort.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional but recommended).

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Saummya123/SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE.

4. Locate and run the Main class to start the application.

## Usage
- Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the speed slider to control animation speed.
- Set the array size if needed.
- Click the **Start** button to begin visualizing the sorting process.
- Use **Pause** and **Reset** buttons as necessary.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The program generates a random array of integers.
- Upon starting, the selected sorting algorithm sorts the array.
- The GUI animates the process by displaying bars representing array elements.
- Each swap or comparison is visually represented in real-time.
