# SortingVisualizer - Java GUI Project

## 📌 Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based application designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work through interactive graphical animations. The visualizer offers an educational and engaging experience by demonstrating step-by-step sorting processes.

## 🎯 Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly and intuitive Java Swing-based GUI.
- **Supported Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Radix Sort
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch sorting algorithms animate step-by-step.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Control animation speed for better understanding.
- **Custom Array Size:** Choose the number of elements to sort.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional but recommended).

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saummya123/SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI.git
2.Navigate to the project directory: cd SortingVisualizer-Java-GUI
3.Open the project in your favorite IDE.
4.Locate and run the Main class to start the application.
## Usage
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust the speed slider to control animation speed.
Set the array size if needed.
Click the Start button to begin visualizing the sorting process.
Use Pause and Reset buttons as necessary.
# 🛠️ How It Works
The program generates a random array of integers.
Upon starting, the selected sorting algorithm sorts the array.
The GUI animates the process by displaying bars representing array elements.
Each swap or comparison is visually represented in real-time.
